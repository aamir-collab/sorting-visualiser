This repo is an attempt to help in learning popular sorting algorithms by visualization

Helps to

-understand the working of sorting algorithm
-check total swaps required
-check total comparisions
-know the time taken (time is just an approximate unit for comparision)

Features

-Sort any given array of any size
-Alter the speed of execution
-Generate random array of numbers of sorting
-space and time complexity of the algorithms

Features built using
-Animations are done using pure CSS and uses FLIP principle
-Flex is used for array display and manipulation of positions (flex order property)
-JavaScript async generators are used heavily for the controlled execution of algorithms
