<b>This repo is an attempt to help in learning popular sorting algorithms by visualization</b>

<b>Helps to</b>
<br/>
-understand the working of sorting algorithm
<br/>
-check total swaps required
<br/>
-check total comparisions
<br/>
-know the time taken (time is just an approximate unit for comparision)
<br/>

<b>Features</b>
-Sort any given array of any size
<br/>
-Alter the speed of execution
<br/>
-Generate random array of numbers of sorting
<br/>
-space and time complexity of the algorithms
<br/>

<b>Features built using</b>
<br/>
-Animations are done using pure CSS and uses FLIP principle
<br/>
-Flex is used for array display and manipulation of positions (flex order property)
<br/>
-JavaScript async generators are used heavily for the controlled execution of algorithms
<br/>
